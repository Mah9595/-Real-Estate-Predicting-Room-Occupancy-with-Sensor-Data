# [Real Estate] Predicting Room Occupancy with Sensor Data

Operating an office space when running a business is an expensive affair. On top of rent, you have to pay maintenance and operation costs, including for utilities, such as electricity and water. On the household level, this amount is usually pretty small. On the office level, this can go up to thousands of dollars a month.

Evidently, conserving energy in the office can save the company money. One way to do this is to have lights automatically switch off when no one is in the office. To do that, one would need smart devices to predict room occupancy. 

This is where you come in.  

In this UpLevel project, you will work with sensor data collected over two weeks and train a model to predict room occupancy. You will also investigate the impact of select features and learn to use your intuition to interpret the data. 

You will be working with a beginner-friendly dataset, found in the UCI Machine Learning repository here.
